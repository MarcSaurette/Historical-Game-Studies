# Exercises\*

### Learning Together

Through the term, students must complete exercises which complement each week's readings.&#x20;

Examples of the kinds of exercises we will do:

* learn how to use note-making software ([Obsidian](../digital-tools/obsidian/)) and practice best scholarly knowledge production
* annotate a scholarly article together - using [hypothes.is](../digital-tools/hypothes.is.md) to understand its structure and purpose (in order to teach how to read secondary sources)&#x20;
* practice different forms of Historical Game Analysis

In the [detailed outline for each week](broken-reference), I will post links to detailed instructions of the pertinent exercise.
