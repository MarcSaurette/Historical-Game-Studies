# Transitory notes

Often when we have an idea, we try to jot it down somewhere and then hope we find it again later. But often we don't ... we just lose the note and then lose the idea we had!

The smart notes process asks people to get things into a note when you have a good thought, and then come back to it later. To have lots of random notes that you process and make sense of. They key to the smart note process is to have ideas, record them and then make sense of them, by adding them to your vault. In class, we will practice this process again and again over the course of the term.&#x20;
