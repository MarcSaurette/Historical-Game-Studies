# 3B. Game Design Document

**Due**: April 10th, 2024 (by 5pm)

**Weight**: 25% of final grade

**Medium**: Any

**Stream**: Game Design

**Length:** (\~2000 words minimum, no max)

Your goal is to develop a detailed game design document (hereafter GDD, based on the [template](https://rosacarbo.notion.site/Game-design-wiki-6902c5dc9d1242c9a70822f13e6c76b3) by Rosa Carbo-Mascarell, ported to Obsidian by Shawn Graham). This document will ask you to think through and develop detailed descriptions of game mechanics and game play for a possible game of your own design. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Different games require different amounts of work. If your goal is a resource-heavy original digital game, your GDD will be thinking about potential features since it would be impossible to complete the entire game this semester. If you are working on a new version of the [Timeline](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128664/timeline) card game, however, you might be able to create a card deck, rulebook and annotations completely.&#x20;

This project will tend to be more descriptive than the other two final assignments, so students may have the propensity to exceed the suggested \~2000 word length. As long as the GDD is not filled with extraneous material, there is no maximum length.
