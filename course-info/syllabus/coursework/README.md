# Coursework

All written work must be completed for a student to pass the course.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Participation" %}
So, let's get this out in the open. Participation is always difficult to assess. Even in face-to-face classes, I can measure what I see, but I don't know the work that has been done behind the scenes (especially if you are a quiet or shy student). So typically, I have had students assign themselves a mark for participation each class – based on a rubric assigning points for attendence and for degree of participation.&#x20;

I will take attendance and at the end of each class, will request that you assign yourself a mark out of 5 for the quality of your participation. At the end of each term, you will write up a process letter explaining the quality of your participation, part of which will be to assess your contributions to class discussion.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Notes" %}
The key to academic success is practice – especially practicing writing. Writing is hard for everyone, especially when a genre is unfamiliar or the expectations are unclear. I'll make the expectations clear and over time the expected norms of writing will become familiar to you. Above all I just want you to get used to writing without worrying too much about being perfect at it.&#x20;

We are using [Obsidian](../../digital-tools/obsidian/) to help you practice different kinds of writing - citing works properly, turning the texts of experts into your own words, and then processing these ideas.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Exercises" %}
Some weeks we will complete exercises to introduce you to different tools in the Historical Games Studies/ Medievalist toolkit. This might be me demonstating how to use Hypothes.is or getting you to complete a multi-stage library search on your own.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Project" %}
You will use your own interests to structure your assignments, and you will choose a path to complete the three major assignments that aligns with your scholarly and professional goals.

All students will complete the first assignment, the annotated bibliography. After completing your annotated bibliography, you will pick one of the following paths, which will determine your other two assignments for the course. You should build on the research you have already completed in your

annotated bibliography to complete the other two assignments.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Feedback" %}
&#x20;You will be asked to provide comments and constructive criticism to written work completed by your peers ([expectations set out here](peer-feedback.md)). We'll use the annotation tool [hypothes.is](../../digital-tools/hypothes.is.md) or in-built commenting functions if they are shared as word processors files (Google Docs/ Word).&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Process Letter" %}
A "[proces letter](process-letters.md)" is a term we use to describe an end-of-term self-evaluation of your own work. You will write this up as a way to justify the grade you will assign to yourself for first term, based on guided questions I will provide. Some of your work will be done in groups, so part of your letter will be the pleasant job of acknowledging those who did an exceptional job and the more difficult one of calling out those who were less satisfactory.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In the second term, the class will work on a [group project ](reflections/game-design-project.md)or two, that we will work on each week in order to develop a new historically- inspired game.&#x20;

### **Each week you will:**&#x20;

* prepare for class by completing the assigned readings and making annotations on the texts (primary sources, secondary sources, images, websites) with [Hypothes.is](../../digital-tools/hypothes.is.md).
* attend seminars, where I will lecture or lead a discussion  and answer questions, or run an exercise
* complete weekly exercises (usually begun in class) intended to practice foundational skills of History/ Medieval Studies/Historical Game Studies
* write notes for the class and your gameplay with [Obsidian](../../digital-tools/obsidian/)
* play games and think about them and then [write about them](reflections/game-journal.md).
