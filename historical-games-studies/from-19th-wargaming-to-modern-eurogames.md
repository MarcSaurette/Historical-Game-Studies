# From 19th wargaming to modern Eurogames

### Goals for this week (November 14/16th)



### Overview:

On Monday, we will discuss the readings, thinking about why the Middle Ages provides such a diverse and contradictory space for gaming.&#x20;

On Wednesday, we will review progress on the game journal and explore the context of _Crusader Kings III_. We will work together as a group to figure out how to discern the context of the game.&#x20;
