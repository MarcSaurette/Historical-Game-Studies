# Medieval Games

### Goals for this week (October 3/5th)

Our goal this week is to survey the history of play and games during the Middle Ages.&#x20;

* On Monday, the professor will lecture about the history of games (touching a bit on Antiquity) and tracing the development of different types and genres of games/play.&#x20;
* On Wednesday, we will attempt to play the game Hazard, a common medieval dice game. Take a look at a medieval manuscript describing it and other games at the court of Alfonso X. Your goal is to figure out the rules of Hazard/ Azar before class and be able to explain it to someone else.&#x20;

The rules for Hazard from this manuscript are communicated in this article:

* Jesús Basulto, José Antonio Camùnez et Francisco Javier Ortega, « Azar game in the book of the dice of Alfonso X The Learned. Its relation with the hazard games of Montmort, Cotton, Hoyle, De Moivre and Jacob Bernoulli », _Mathématiques et sciences humaines_, 174 | Summer 2006,  [http://journals.openedition.org/msh/3546](http://journals.openedition.org/msh/3546) ; DOI : https://doi.org/10.4000/msh.3546

The first rules of Hazard in English (I believe) are described here in [chapter 30 ](https://books.google.ca/books?id=FupmAAAAcAAJ\&pg=PA168#v=onepage\&q\&f=false)of the obviously not-medieval compendium of games:&#x20;

* _The Compleat Gamester; Or, Instructions how to Play at Billiards, Trucks, Bowls and Chess ... Cards ... Dice, To which is Added the Arts ... of Riding, Racing, Archery, and Cockfighting_ (1674)

### Practice

Create reference notes, as outlined in [exercise 4](../course-info/assignments/4.-writing-up-a-reference-note.md).&#x20;

Part of learning about games is playing them. I will host a game afternoon on Thursdays, so that we can get practice and experience with games.&#x20;

This is an experiment.&#x20;

Given our different schedules and demands on our time, it is not always easy to get together in the same room outside of class time. I am going to ask people to sign up for an account on [Boardgame Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/welcome), which is an online space for playing (digitized) boardgames.&#x20;

I've put together a class group, which I think will require that I invite people to it. I will need your account name to find and invite you. Add it to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11qySQYeDCusmpIE28vK8rXUAB9KG5S8Ex-gD5SdNE6g/edit?usp=sharing).
