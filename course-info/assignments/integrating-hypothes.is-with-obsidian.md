Then, once that window is open, starting typing "insert"

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.59.32 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will reduce the number of options you can choose. Click on "Templater: Open Insert Template Modal". And then, click on "hypothesis".

The first time you use "templater" in a vault, Obsidian will require you to give it your user token. This is so that Obsidian can access your hypothesis annotations and download them seamlessly.&#x20;

Navigate to the address provided ([https://hypothes.is/account/developer](https://hypothes.is/account/developer)) in a browser in which you are signed on to hypothesis. This page will provide you with a series of numbers and letters that you should copy and paste into the Obsidian window. You will then be asked how to import the annotations.

Choose the first option. And use the url for _The Devil's Historians is_ [_https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks5/upress5/2020-06-01/1/9781487587871#annotations:w6hExjXcEe25k0PGvdul6Q_](https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks5/upress5/2020-06-01/1/9781487587871#annotations:w6hExjXcEe25k0PGvdul6Q)

Now, because of the vagaries of proxies and permissions of accessing Library resources hosted by academic publishers behind paywalls. If the URL given doesn't work, use templater again and instead use "Retrieve annotations from a day" and then choose the date (year, month, day) that you made the annotations (likely today's date).&#x20;

You will then get a note populated with quotations from the source you read and your comments on it. Hypothes.is (and then Obsidian) will provide a title inside your note for the work you annotated, but they are not always relevent (i.e. the academic publisher "Scholar's Portal" substitutes for the name of the book you read.&#x20;

Locate this .md file (mine was called "Literature Note for Sturtevant-Kaufman - 2020.md") and drag it into your Student Work folder on Teams. If you haven't created a folder for yourself in Student Work (which is unlikely), navigate to the General channel, click on the "Files" toptab, then click on "Student Work" folder to open it, and then within that, create your self-named folder by clicking on the purple "New" button. Then upload your md file by dragging and dropping into your newly created folder.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.27.11 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

And finally, right click on your md file in Teams and "copy link". Post this link in the "My first Literature Notes link" in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11qySQYeDCusmpIE28vK8rXUAB9KG5S8Ex-gD5SdNE6g/edit?usp=sharing). On this spreadsheet also add other information requested, that you have developed during the [tutorial level](broken-reference).&#x20;

### Great! You're done!
