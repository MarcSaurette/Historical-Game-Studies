# 4. Reference/Literature Notes

### Overview

The goal behind Obsidian is to contain all the information for a project in one place - notes, drafts, evidence. In Ahrens' _Smartnotes_ system, we are meant to track _what_ we read_, how_ we thinking about the readings and how this develops _new ideas_. He sees notetaking as an engine to develop new ideas and thoughts. He treats reference notes and literature notes as two different things (one is like an index card with a single reference on it; and a literature note is a series of cards that arise from it).&#x20;

For our purposes, I suggest that we treat reference notes and literature notes as the same and add a bibliographic reference as simple text. In more advanced uses of Obsidian you can import references as single entries in a larger database and so sometime it can make sense to have a stand-alone reference note for a work, but at this stage we will ignore this potentiality.&#x20;

### Before you start:

1. For this exercise, you will need to have completed exercises 3 and 3b, getting Obsidian installed and imported the class Obsidian vault.
2. And in order to complete this assignment, you will need to have annotated the readings for this [week](../../fundamentals/what-do-games-teach.md) with Hypothes.is, Obsidian Annotator or Zotero (for this assignment it doesn't matter which you used).&#x20;

* If you have used Zotero you will have to manually copy your annotations from Zotero. Select your annotations note (if you have created one) and copy it wholesale into an annotations note.&#x20;

### Create a literature note

{% hint style="info" %}
I am laying out the instructions for a single literature note, but you should write up a literature note for each of the readings for this week.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Open up Obsidian and create a new note. This can be done simply by using the key stroke "control+n" (Windows) or "⌘+n" for a Mac. Or navigate to the top left corner and click on the pen and paper icon.&#x20;

If you do either of these options, a new note with the name "untitled" will appear in your main folder. You likely will want to put it into the literature folder (you can drag and drop it). Or avoid this step by right-clicking on the Literature folder and selecting "New note" which will create a new note in the folder.&#x20;

You now need to insert a template. Select the templater icon "<%" on the left sidebar and select "literature note template". It will autopopulate your note with instructions for the note.&#x20;

</div>

Now, fill in the properties:&#x20;

* add a title (usually author - title - date of publication; or a variation that makes sense to you and your citation style). Add a title both for the note and in the properties section.&#x20;
* Add a project (it could be class, "Historical Game Studies")
* Add the date
* And add any tags - type in key words that emerged from your reading or also take keywords the publisher might already have posted for the work. To add tags, you type in a word and then hit the "return" key. You might want to come back to this section again at then end of doing a literature note, with additional tags.&#x20;

Your goal is then to complete the note with a bibliographic citation, add a summary of the work/ your thoughts on it, copy in your annotations and then make a list of links which are related.&#x20;

1. **Bibliographic citation**.&#x20;
   1. You can copy and paste the citation of the work from the list of readings (for this week, [here](../../fundamentals/what-do-games-teach.md)), though I am a bit fast and loose with how I cite. If you're generating a larger bibliography in the future (as you will be) you may wish to establish a firm standard for yourself in advance.&#x20;
   2. If you are using [Zotero](../digital-tools/zotero/), you can also right-click on an entry for the work you're  writing a literature note about and "Create bibliography" (and select the "copy to clipboard" option).  Copy your citation into the 'Work Title" section.

2. &#x20;Write up a **summary** of the work.&#x20;
   1. You might want to come back and complete this at the end of the process, but if you've already read through and annotated the work, you likely have a clear sense of what its usefulness is. &#x20;
   2. This summary should be written to highlight the key ideas you took away from the work and how you might find it useful in the future. If you are working towards a proposal, for example, you should highlight in this summary how it might help that future project. If you are interrogating a specific question for a larger project, you should note how the work connects to it and is useful (or not). Be explicit about relevance (e.g. "The title makes it seem like an overview of topic X but the book is actually a narrow case study of subtopic Y." Or, "When author X uses the word "game", they actually mean "card game, so the book falls short of covering X, Y and Z").
3. Add your annotations.&#x20;
