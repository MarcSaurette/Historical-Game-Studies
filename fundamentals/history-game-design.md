# History Game Design\*

### Goals:&#x20;

* Consider how to design a History Game
* Examine examples of history games designs and evaluate the success or the compromises necessary to the process.&#x20;
* Discuss the two Free Topic classes:
  * What two topics should we choose?
  * Should we shift them around with the Student Presentation days?
