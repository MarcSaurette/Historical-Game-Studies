# What is History?

### Goals for this week (September 12/14, 2022)

By the end of the second week, what should you **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

1. You will learn about History as an academic discipline and as a field of study, including some key terms and ideas foundational for understanding the learning we will do in this course.&#x20;
2. You will practice reading academic writing and will learn strategies for engaging productively with ideas in text – turning them into your own words/ thoughts. We will discuss the concept and practices of making "[smart notes](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes)".&#x20;
3. We will go over using Teams, Obsidian and Hypothesis - three digital tools key for this course.
4. We will practice making notes on [Obsidian](../course-info/digital-tools/obsidian/) and learn to import annotations from hypothes.is. Students will write and upload a literature-note to Teams showing they have successfully done so.&#x20;
5. Students must sign up to submit [classnotes](broken-reference) twice a term by September 14th. [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sCloWfNgj3t\_YD8-vx2toFdw4BbTuWXFHJr2mHYP5zc/edit?usp=sharing).

### Overview:

The class introduces you to the discipline of History, major concerns and questions, as well as debates about the nature of history. We will also practice&#x20;

1. By Monday's class, students will need to have read, Danielle Kinsey's "Three Points About History, Especially for Non-Historians." _Canadian Journal of History_ 54, no. 1 (2019): 1-20. [https://www-utpjournals-press.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.3138/cjh.ach.54.1-2.01](https://www-utpjournals-press.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.3138/cjh.ach.54.1-2.01)
2. On Monday, we will explore together the question, "What is History?" I will introduce students to different debates on the topic. We will explore how historical learning and knowledge of history is important (or not important) in our society. We will spend some time talking about the Kinsey reading. Be prepared to come talk generally about how history seems relevent to your lives. We might consider such questions as:
   1. what is the difference between the past and history?
   2. what is the nature of History, as practiced in university vs. what we consider popular or public history?
   3. where does the idea and the academic discipline of history come from?
   4. what is the use of history? how can history be misused?
   5. where do you get your 'history' from?
3. On Wednesday, we will introduce students to two tools: [Obsidian](../course-info/digital-tools/obsidian/) and [Hypothes.is](../course-info/digital-tools/hypothes.is.md). In class, we get students to make use of these two tools, and get hypothes.is integrated with Obsidian. We will practice making notes and using basic tools in Obsidian. We will then reread and annotate the Kinsey article together, using hypothes.is.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

### Practice

This week your goal is to ensure that you have downloaded and installed the class Obsidian starter "vault" and integrated hypothe.is. By **Monday, September 19th,** you need to upload a literature-note for Kinsey's article (showing downloaded annotations) to your student-work folder on Teams (Each student is asked to create a folder for themself in the "Student Work" folder in the general channel files.&#x20;

Since we did not get as far as I hoped in class, students will be expected to complete this exercise on their own time. [Instructions here](../course-info/assignments/1.-introduction-to-hypothes.is.md).&#x20;
