# Do we take shelter - Playtest

### Goals

This week, we will playtest _Do we take shelter? –_ a Reacting to the Past inspired mini-game asking students to play as residents of Manchester in 1940. You must use the information available to you and your family to decide when to travel to a bomb shelter to take refuge from German bombs.&#x20;

Our goals for the playtest is:

* to experience a pedagogical History role playing game
* to evaluate whether the game succeeds in its objectives (teach information literacy)
* to offer constructive criticism to the game designer about changes (large and small) that would improve the pedagogical intent and the gameplay.&#x20;

During gameplay, students should jot down notes to refer back to, for the discussion in the following class.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

In advance of the class, the designer (Martha Attridge Bufton) will enroll students in a sandboxed Brightspace instance. Access to game materials and supplemental materials will be available there. Students will be required to read:

* The Player Manual: [https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/gamerguidedowetakeshelter/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/gamerguidedowetakeshelter/)
* Martha will assign each student a character. She will send directly that sheet to the student.&#x20;
