# 3. Writing up idea and brainstorming notes

This week, I want students to complete two notes:&#x20;

1. An idea or concept note answering the question, "What is a game?" based on the two assigned Nguyen readings and perhaps some additional research.
2. The second is a brainstorming note.&#x20;

### 1. Idea notes

The two readings by C.T. Nguyen provide students with the basic building blocks for answering the question, "What is a game?".&#x20;

**A. Read** through the two articles, highlighting and annotating with hypothes.is so that you will be able to reconstruct their key arguments and idea.

* with your annotations make sure you have made clear _**your**_** thoughts** about Nguyen's ideas/words and provide some mental context so that you can make sense of the text that gets downloaded into Obsidian
* when you are reading through Nguyen's texts, identify **terminology** that seems key, but is new to you. To make these easy to find by you later, tag new terminology with a tag such as, "#NewTerminology" or "NeedToDefine" or "KeyConcept". You can also use a hierarchical system in Obsidian "Game/Definition" or "Game/Purpose" (which allows tags to be formed into groups).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
While hypothes.is is happy to use tags that are multiple words, Obsidian is not and won't recognize them (i.e. will use only the first word as a tag)
{% endhint %}

**B. Import** your hypothesis annotations into two new notes.&#x20;

* Name the new notes "Annotations - Nguyen - 2016" for the article in _Philosophy Compass_ and the other "Annotations - Nguyen - 2020" for the chapter in _Games: Agency as Art_.&#x20;
* Anytime you import from Hypothes.is, you should name the files consistently, defining what kind of note it is (annotations), referring to the author (in this case, Nguyen) and date (2016/2020) of the publication.&#x20;

**C. Create** a new permanent note, with a title something like, "What is a Game", "What are games?" or "Games: a definition" or something that makes sense to you.

1. Insert the permanent note template into the note
2. Add a new header, "### Terminology" underneath the "Tags" header (we'll come back to this later)

**D. Work to Understand** the idea a bit more.&#x20;

1. Drawing on terminology and concepts you identified as key in your annotations, add a list of words (under the new header "Terminology" that you have read but might not understand or that you think are important fundemental ideas that you want to know more about (these might be words you tagged as "DidNotUnderstand" or "KeyIdea" or something similar.&#x20;

* list all the words that you didn't understand from the readings in your note;&#x20;
* distinguish between words which are new to you (which you are learning for the first time) and other words which you already know, but seem to be used by Nguyen in a new way. Some words are just academic jargon (using a higher register of English to sound academic) and others are precise conceptual terminology. Put the terminology that seem like the latter (e.g. percise conceptual language) in its own group.
* e.g. you all know what agent means, but maybe not in this context
* e.g. you know what "achievement" or "striving" means, but not when Nguyen distinguishes between "achievement-play" and "striving-play".&#x20;
* then find a way to define these words (provide links to proper definitions from one of the two references works below for future-you.

{% hint style="info" %}
I recommend the online [Encyclopedia of Ludic Terms](https://eolt.org/) (English "ludic" is an adjective derived from the Latin, _ludus â€“_ game, play, sport, pastime). It is a useful and developing resource for studying games.

I also recommend the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL\_CRL/hgdufh/alma991022606770905153) (OED Online) for looking up terminology. It provides a compilation of historical uses (i.e. when a term first appears, how it changes over time) to help you understand the conceptual linkages words have.
{% endhint %}

**E. Populate** your note with a few paragraphs summarizing Nguyen and your ideas about how to define a game.&#x20;

1. Either by embedding notes from your annotations of Nguyen's texts, or by copy-and-pasting them, provide key supporting material for your definition of what a game is. Be selective of any quotations to make sure that they are necessary. The key is, however, if you have a quotation, you need to explain it in your own words.&#x20;
2. In historical writing, we argue based on fundamental evidence. We either base our arguments on what scholars have written (secondary sources) or we use evidence of the past (primary sources). For this course, our primary sources will tend to be games or written accounts/ descriptions of games. You should define what a game is either by using Nguyen's words/ideas and what they urge you to think or from the evidence of games you have played or know about.&#x20;
3. Your goal is therefore to link together your ideas from the annotations, Nguyen's words and other material necessary to organize this material into a logical order/argument. You may want to create subsections in the Idea section (the current headers use ###; to make a lower-level header, use ####) to distinguish between defining what a game is (according to Nguyen) from how a game has been defined by people like Huizinga, Caillois etc.&#x20;
4. Once you finish the idea sections, then add tags.

**F. Congratulations!** You're done the hard part.&#x20;

### 2. Brainstorming note

This note is meant to be the kernel of a future index note (similar to the one we created last week). Nguyen's work will give you some things to think about and some different ways of categorizing games. I want you to take that thinking and turn your analytical focus on yourself.&#x20;

Create a blank note and call it "My Games", "My Game Log" or "Games I have Played" or something similarly titled that works for you.&#x20;

Start by making a list of all the games you think you have ever played. I mean ever. Like even when you were 4 years old.&#x20;

* Partly my goal in getting you to do this, is to show you that you have all played _a lot_ of games. Nguyen ultimately sees everything as a game (anything involving winning points can be treated as a game by him - including grades in school), so make sure you have a good sense of what YOU think is a game before you get started.&#x20;

For any game you have played that you think could be classed as "medieval" put the name of that game in **\[\[square brackets]]**. Anything from \[\[Dark Souls]] or \[\[Minecraft]] to \[\[Princess Party Tea Party]] counts.&#x20;

Possible games you have played:

* **schoolyard games**&#x20;
  * my 7 year currently players a lot of "grounders" which I did not growing up, is this an Ontario thing?
  * hopscotch? foursquare? spin-the-bottle?
* **sports/ athletics**
* **make believe games**&#x20;
  * dressing up as a child?
* **board games/table top games**
* **role-playing games/ live action role play**
* **social games**
* **card games**
* **mobile games**
* **console games**
* **computer games**

When you have made your big long list, try to see if there are commonalities. If you play a lot of digital games do they show overlapping genres (hack and slash fantasy, first person shooters, racing games, abstract spatial games etc.)?

Spend a bit of time trying to categorize your game experiences into groups.&#x20;

And then you're almost done. Upload these two notes to your Student Work folder on Teams and you're done!
