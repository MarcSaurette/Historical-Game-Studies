### What Type of Player Are You?

\[_from Fernández-Vara, 2015, p. 29-30_]

Since we must be aware of what type of player we are, here are some questions that you can ask yourself to figure out your player profile. This exercise will also help you realize that you may be a different type of player depending on the game or the context.

1. What game genres do you like playing? (Feel free to add your own)
   *   Non-digital games

       * Card games
       * Board games
       * Sports
       * Playground games


   *   Digital games

       * Puzzle games
       * Adventure games
       * Role-playing games
       * Action-adventure games
       * Turn-based strategy games
       * Real-time strategy games
       * Racing games
       * Sports games
       * Casual games
       * Art games
       * Massively multiplayer online games
       * Massively multiplayer role-playing online games
       * Social games
       * First-person shooter


2. What do you play for?
   * Problem-solving
   * Achievements
   * Socializing
   * Exploration
   * Learning
   * Finding the optimal strategy
   * Relaxation/stress management
   * Self-improvement
   * Curiosity
   *
3. How many hours do you play?
   * Not at all, this is homework.
   * 1–5 hours a week
   * 5–10 hours a week
   * 10–15 hours a week
   * 20+ hours

Based on your responses, write up your own profile as a player.

* What types of games do you know best?
* Which ones are you good at?
* Which games do you not really play?
* Why do you like the games you like?
* There will be games you do not care about; why is that?

You may realize that you play different genres for different reasons, so your profile may need different sections depending on the genres you play. This exercise will help you make explicit your own biases, not only about games, but also about how others may play games – if they are different from you.
