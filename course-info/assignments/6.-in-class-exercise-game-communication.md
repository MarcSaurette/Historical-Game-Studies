# 6. In-class exercise: Game Communication

### Goals

* to consider how we communicate game play
* to reflect on how written/ spoken rules capture (or don't) how games work

### Requirements:

* knowledge of the rules of Chess
* if desired, bring a Chess set to class or use [chess.com](https://www.chess.com) if you need visual/tangible aids&#x20;
* be ready to explain how chess is played to someone else in class&#x20;

### Products

* tutors will upload their notes to their student work folder on Teams
* pupils will upload their notes to their student work folders on Teams

### Stages:

Our goal is to explain and understand how to play Chess to someone else in class.&#x20;

Half the class will be "tutors" and half the class will be "pupils".&#x20;

**Tutors** will be responsible to provide an initial explanation, and be able to answer questions about what the _pupils_ did not understand. You may make notes in advance to help with this process.&#x20;

**Pupils** will be responsible for taking notes about the experience of learning the game.&#x20;

### Before class, Tutors will write up a note about:

* In what order do you need to communicate information about the rules of chess (i.e. what is the best way to teach someone the rules of chess)?
* what are the most important rules and goals of chess
* how to describe the names, appearance and rules of individual chess pieces

### In class, Pupils will take notes about:&#x20;

* What are the basic rules to get someone started on the game?
* What aspects of the game are easier to understand?
* Which ones are more difficult to pick up?
* How can showing the game itself facilitate the explanation?
