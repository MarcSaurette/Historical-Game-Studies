# History Game Analysis\*

The analysis of History Games is the bread and butter of Historical Games Studies. Predominantly focused on videogames (but increasingly on analog and role-playing games), this field of scholarship tends to explore the representation of the past in modern games.&#x20;

If you wish to pursue this avenue of research, your work will consist of:

1. an annotated bibliography
2. a project proposal
3. a game journal / game survey
