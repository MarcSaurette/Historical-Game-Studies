# 2. Writing up permanent notes

### Requirements:

* You need to have read through the entirety of chapter 1 of _The Devil's Historians_ carefully (and read other people's annotations
* You need to have completed [exercise no. 1](1.-introduction-to-hypothes.is.md) (getting hypothesis installed and working with Obsidian)
* You will need to have adequate information for creating a permanent note, so you may need to further annotate Kaufman and Sturtevant's _The Devil's Historians_

### What you need to do:

* you will create a permanent note listing the major myths of the Middle Ages
* you will create subordinate permanent notes linked from the original note
* you will learn to link to and embed other notes (or parts of them) into a new permanent note

### Steps:

1. Open the class vault in Obsidian.&#x20;
2. To keep things tidy, make a folder called, "Myths of the Middle Ages" or "Medieval Myths" or something. You don't need to, though, since in time you will make sense of things not by ordering things in folders, but by linking notes together and visualizing them. But since this is the first time we're doing this, it might make it easier to find everything. And it will make it easier to copy everything over onto Teams at the end to share your work.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can make a folder by clicking on the folder icon in the top left corner of the sidebar in Obsidian or by right-clicking in the sidebar area.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

3\. Create a new file - call it something like "Index - Myths of the Middle Ages". This is going to be our index note. Then using the command palette (⌘ + p = Mac; Control + P = PC) or click on the command palette icon.&#x20;

4\. Then type "templates" and select "**Templates**: insert template" from the drop down menu, and then select "Permanent-note-template".

5\. You will end up with a note that looks something like this. Congratulations! You have just inserted a simple template into your note. NB: you can edit the simple templates (see the second folder in the vault) which has different kinds of templates there. The goal of templates are to make your notes seem similar, so that you will always know where to find the information you are looking for. You should update the header information, so that the title, date, and project (in our case, it can be the name of our class).&#x20;

The note you are creating, as the title suggests, will be an index or organizing note. And also a note to help find other notes. This is key to note-making is that you have embed a means to find notes later on when you need them again. With obsidian, we have different options that allows your ideas to be discoverable:

1. a permanent note that indexes other notes
2. tags
3. links.&#x20;

We are starting by creating the first and this will help us understand how to use tags and links.&#x20;

A permanent note wants you to do three things,&#x20;

* include tags
* provide a paragraph about the key idea
* provide links

Tags help you locate connections between notes and ideas, the paragraph summarizes for your future self what is the relevence of the idea and then links helps you put stuff together - links to readings online, media, or in our case, a list of links to notes.&#x20;

**I. Tags:** You can use #hashtags or you use tags between square brackets "\[\[name]]". These are _de facto_ links that Obsidian will use to map correlations and connections. Tags should not describe the general topic (becuase that is already established in the title of your note), but concepts that you're interested that the note might address.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-20 at 2.33.05 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you use a square bracket to tag something, you are making a note, though in this case, it is only a hypothetical note (if you were to click on the note link a note with that title would then be created). But we'll come back to that in a moment. Tags you might use:

* **Meta** tags which categorize the note: #exercise #notes/practice, #readings #week3
* **Conceptual** tags, which hint at the links to ideas you want to think about: #barbarian, #medievalism, #religious-conflict, #Is-History-progressive?

**II. Idea:** this section should be a summary of what the importance of the note's topic is. Your goal for this section, is to define succinctly:

1. What is the "myth of the Middle Ages"?
2. Why historians care about these myths?

This section shouldn't list the myths, but rather should try to define what is the idea unifying the various myths (hint: this will be clearly stated in the introduction and conclusion of the chapter), if you are seeking to transmit what Kaufman and Sturtevant describe. Please feel free to add your thoughts in reaction to theirs as well. Also, do not simply quote what Kaufman and Sturtevant have said, but tell the reader (i.e. your future self) in your own words what they said/they mean/what you took away from them.&#x20;

**III. Links:** this section links to key resources, notes, media etc. In our case, we are making an index note to (future) notes about myths about the Middle Ages. For how to code links using Obsidian, here is their [guide](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Internal+link): [https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Internal+link](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Internal+link)

Take a look at the reading again, and you will note that on page 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 27 there are headers designating different myths the authors are addressing. In your note, therefore you will have at least 6 links (or a list of 6 titles between two square brackets \[\[likethis]].

</div>

**IV. New Notes:** You may have already noticed by accident that when you click on these titles inside square brackets, you create a new note with the same title as what you put in the brackets. If you click on one of those links, while holding the ⌘ button (on a Mac; Control button on a PC), then a new note will be created in a new column. Try doing that with one of your links.&#x20;

In your new note, entitled, "Pretext" in my case, insert a template of a permanent note. And add a new section, entitled, "Examples". Make it a header by adding "###" before the word Examples. Then fill in the new note (if you are starting from the first myth, the title will be something like "Life is Nasty, Brutish and Short - a quotation from Thomas Hobbes). Then, add tags, a summary of the idea, make any links, and write down any examples you can think of that fit with that myth. Your note should look something like this (except obviously it is not about Eco's article).&#x20;

**Then repeat, for the remaining 5 myths**. The notes can be relatively short, but they need to concisely describe the myth. These notes are like "stubs" on Wikipedia – short entries that exist before they are fully fleshed out. My hope is that these myths will help you take notes as you examine games and other Medievalisms.&#x20;

If you have annotated the chapter well, you may have already identified all the important quotations and made comments on them, you will be able to embed these in your new notes. After you add the template, you can copy sections from your annotations by using the syntax. To link to an my annotations of Kinsey's article, for example, you would use the following syntax. Copy and paste it into a note to see what happens.&#x20;

```
// ![[Annotations for Kinsey_2019#^cfab4e]]
```

It should link to a quotation from a note I prepopulated in the vault. The "!" tells Obsidian to embed something, then double brackets tells Obsidian, it should embed an Obsidian note, and the "^" means that you only want to embed a section of a note". After you type the "^"  Obsidian should automatically offer you sections of text to embed and then it automatically generates the code once you select a potion.&#x20;

Obsidian will naturally create your new notes in the main vault, so likely it is a good idea to copy your new notes into your folder created for this exercise, by dragging and dropping them. You can also move them using the command palette command but that's a little bit harder.&#x20;

Now take a look at how your notes are starting to link. Press on the "graphing icon" which will allow you to see the connections between your notes:

As a final step, copy your Myths of the Middle Ages folder into your Student Work folder on Teams.
