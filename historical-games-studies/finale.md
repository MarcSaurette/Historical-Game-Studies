# Finale

### Goals for December 9th

Carleton does something that might seem weird. In order to make sure that all classes have an equal number of meetings, they add an extra Monday class on the final Friday of term. This is because the class that we all thought was a holiday on Thanksgiving Monday is really just balanced out on December 9th.&#x20;

**December 9th is the last day of term to submit work**. Therefore, your final project is due on this day.&#x20;

On this last day of class, we are going to meet to review the semester and discuss your work on the game journal project. We will talk about the [process letter](../course-info/syllabus/coursework/process-letters.md) which students will need to fill out to describe and self-assess their work in the Fall term. You will also need to justify your self-assessment in it.&#x20;

Today is the deadline to submit written work for Fall classes. You will need to submit your revised game journal. i.e. it should remain as Obsidian notes, but each note for the game journal should be revised and integrated with other notes, as well as the addition of an introduction and a conclusion.&#x20;
