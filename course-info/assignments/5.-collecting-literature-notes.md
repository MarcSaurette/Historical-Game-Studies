# 5. Collecting Literature Notes

In order to complete an annotated bibliography, I am asking students to use Obsidian to link their notes together and embed one note in another. I have created an annotated bibliography template that you can use.&#x20;

### Steps

1. Download the newly created [Annotated Bibliography Template](https://cmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/sites/HistoricalGamesStudies/Shared%20Documents/General/HGS%20-%202024%20-%20Shared%20Vault/\_simple-templates/annotated-bibliography-template.md?csf=1\&web=1\&e=8raxHN) and copy it to your "\_simple-templates" folder.&#x20;
2. Create a new folder in Obsidian. Call it something like "YourName-Annotated Bibliography".&#x20;
