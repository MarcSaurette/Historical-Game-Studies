# How to analyze History games

### Goals:&#x20;

* This week we will read different historical approaches to games including a few examples of what this looks like.&#x20;
* Our focus this week will be on _modern_ history games, that is, contemporary games that represent the past. We need to ask what are the suitable objects of our analysis as historians and what kinds of questions should we ask (and answer).
* By classtime, you should have installed Obsidian and completed exercises [3](../course-info/assignments/3.-starting-with-obsidian.md) and [3b](../course-info/assignments/3b.-annotating-with-obsidian.md). &#x20;

* The standard work for video game analysis, laying out a clear methodology and framework for studying games from a media/communications perspective.&#x20;

You might also want to listen to the (now archived) Studying Pixels podcast. In one of their final episodes, the podcast speak with Theresa Tannebaum about her idea of "close playing" (analogous to _close reading_).&#x20;
