# Library Games

### Goals for this week (October 12th)

Given Thanksgiving Monday is a holiday, we will only be meeting on Wednesday.&#x20;

On this day, we will play a game developed by some of our librarians to help you discern and distinguish different kinds of sources. It is, in fact, called _Sources._&#x20;

At 12:30, however, we will send you off into the world, to complete a Scavenger Hunt, introducing you (mostly) to resources in the library. You will complete some of the work in groups together, and a few items will be completed by working either together or individually doing some online research.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

Nothing this week.&#x20;

### Practice

You will need to complete a Scavenger hunt in small groups to demonstrate a superficial awareness, at minimum, of different resources on campus. Instructions for the scavenger hunt will be released on Wednesday at 1230.&#x20;
