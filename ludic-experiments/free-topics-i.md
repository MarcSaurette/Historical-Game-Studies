# Free Topics I

The topics and readings in the final two weeks of class will be selected at the beginning of March to reflect the developing interests of the students and the work in which  they are engaged. Students are encouraged to submit suggestions for topics (or specific readings).

These two weeks are intended to have readings and discussions that help move forward the work on the student projects which are due at the end of term.&#x20;

Possible topics could include:

* gender and history games/ game design
* race and history games/game design
* historical accuracy vs authenticity
* Public History and Games
* nostalgia
* the materiality of games
* an overview of a time period or theme in modern games
* focus on a particular historian/ theorist (e.g. Jeremiah McCall, Adam Chapman).&#x20;
