Our classes are scheduled take place on Wednesdays, 11h30-14h30. Our class is located in <mark style="color:red;">**room 436 of Paterson Hall**</mark>.&#x20;

We will also be using a number of online resources to help with communication, file sharing and explaining learning activities. We will use Teams as our online repository and communications hub. We will also be using Obsidian as note taker software to work with the _Smartnotes_ system.&#x20;

1. Make sure you have activated your free Carleton [Microsoft](course-info/digital-tools/office.md) license before the first class.
2. [Install Teams](course-info/digital-tools/teams.md) on your computer and set it up. If at all possible, don't use the browser version.
