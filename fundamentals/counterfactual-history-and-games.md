[How to Win a War by Niall Ferguson](https://nymag.com/news/features/22787/)

The historian Niall Ferguson discusses how playing _Making History: The Calm and the Storm_ challenged his counterfactual assumptions regarding the Second World War. Can games or historical games prove surprisingly insightful when it comes to counterfactual history?

[History and Game Design with Chris King, Game Designer, Paradox Development Studio](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023446/History-and-Game)

Chris King, a game designer at Paradox Development Studio, offers insight to how Paradox turns history into games. Take note of how he says Paradox "shops around" (24:39) for historians (or more precisely historical theories) that suggest the best gameplay.

[The 1974 Sandhurst wargame of a hypothetical "Operation Sealion"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\_Sea\_Lion\_\(wargame\))

This was a military war game of _Operation Sealion_, which was a German war plan for invading Britain in 1940. Since the players were professional military officers, this serves as an interesting case study of a "serious game" approach to counterfactual history.
