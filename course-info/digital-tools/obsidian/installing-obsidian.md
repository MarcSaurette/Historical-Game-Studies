# Installing Obsidian

To install Obsidian on your computer or device, navigate to [https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). The landing page will ask you to download files or will link you to an App store. Click on the button (in my case, since I'm using a Mac, it suggests I should download the version for macOS. You can also locate the best install package for your computer at [https://obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download).

Do what you need to do to install it. In macOS, I needed to double click on the downloaded file, and then drag the Obsidian app file into my applications folder. If you're using Windows or Linux, this will look a bit different, but should be relatively easy (and similar) to do.&#x20;

When you successfully install Obsidian and get it running, it will open with a window that looks like this:

Click on 'Open Folder as Vault". It will then ask you whether you trust the author of this vault, Please say yes! It will be much harder for you if you don't.&#x20;

When you install the vault for the class, it will look like the following window. You can navigate through the different notes and folders via the left sidebar.
