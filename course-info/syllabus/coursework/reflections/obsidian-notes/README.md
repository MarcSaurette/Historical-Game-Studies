# Obsidian Notes\*

> "It is much easier to get started if the next step is as feasible as “writing a note,” “collect what is interesting in this paper” or “turning this series of notes into a paragraph” than if we decide to spend the next days with a vague and ill-defined task like “keep working on that overdue paper.”

All of us take notes - for school, for life, we need to record things so we can remember them and make sense of them. In this course, I am hoping to teach you a specific way of taking/making notes that will give you the tools for academic and intellectual success.&#x20;

If you want to know more about the how to take smart notes, I recommend you take a look at the work of Sönke Ahrens, who wrote a concise and readable guide, [_How to take smart notes_](https://takesmartnotes.com)_._ His website contains the kernel of his ideas, which I will also communicate to you through our assignments and exercises. You can also read more about the method from sections of the book posted on the class Teams' "Supplemental Readings" folder.&#x20;

Ahrens' method is not medium dependent - you can do it using paper cards or many different kinds of software, but we (and now Ahrens himself) think Obsidian is the best tool to use. We are making notes using Obsidian because it has the potential to be future-proof for longevity, it allows a considerable improvement over the paper version of note-taking (e.g. its ability to easily link to other notes and incorporate digital media seamlessly), it is free and it has the potential to assist your learning for the entirety of your degree (e.g. its functionality expands as your expertise develops).&#x20;

At the end of term, students will submit their entire Obsidian vault (i.e. folder of work) as part of their end-of-term submission.&#x20;
