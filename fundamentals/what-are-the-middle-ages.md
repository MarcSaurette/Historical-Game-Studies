# What are the Middle Ages?

### Goals for this week (September 19th/21st)

1. Make sure that all students have signed up to submit [classnotes](broken-reference) twice a term. [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sCloWfNgj3t\_YD8-vx2toFdw4BbTuWXFHJr2mHYP5zc/edit?usp=sharing) if you have not already done so.
2. Have students copy information produced in the tutorial level "game" and in our [first exercise](../course-info/assignments/1.-introduction-to-hypothes.is.md) into a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11qySQYeDCusmpIE28vK8rXUAB9KG5S8Ex-gD5SdNE6g/edit?usp=sharing) used to keep track of people's information
3. By the end of this week, students will get initial feedback about their first literature note. The professor will also distribute links to individualized spreadsheets for keeping track of work and receiving feedback.&#x20;
4. Discuss scholarly ideas of the Middle Ages as well as common myths about it; make students aware that many truths we take to be self-evident about the Middle Ages are actually ninteenth-century inventions.&#x20;

### Overview:

The class introduces you to the Middle Ages. The professor will discuss the different ways to define the period and how it has traditionally been defined.&#x20;

* On Monday, the professor will lead a discussion to outline different ways of conceptualizing the period of the Middle Ages.&#x20;
* On Wednesday, we will discuss the reading _The Devil's Historians_ (see below) and consider the many myths of the Middle Ages that circulate in pop culture in our society.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

Read the introduction and chapter one of Kaufman, Amy S., and Paul B. Sturtevant. [_The Devil’s Historians : How Modern Extremists Abuse the Medieval Past_](https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks5/upress5/2020-06-01/1/9781487587871#page=10). Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2020.&#x20;

[_The Devil’s Historians : How Modern Extremists Abuse the Medieval Past_](https://cmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/MEMS2001977/Shared%20Documents/General/Required%20readings/The%20Devil's%20Historians\_%20How%20Modern%20Extremi%20-%20By%20Amy%20S.%20Kaufman%20\(1\).pdf?csf=1\&web=1\&e=uo8nt9) is also posted in the "required readings" folder in the file portion of the General channel.&#x20;

In order to annotate a pdf on your computer (not the internet) with hypothes.is, you will need to download it from Teams and then open the pdf file with the browser you are using with hypothes.is integrated (I recommend Google Chrome). Usually your browser will not be the default software for pdf files, so you will need to right-click (or its equivalent) the file and select the command, "open with" and then select your browser. Hypothes.is will still save your annotations to our group.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Practice

Last week your goal was to download and install the class Obsidian starter "vault" and integrated it with hypothesis. By **Monday, September 19th,** you will need to have uploaded a literature-note. I had originally thought we would do this with Kinsey's article but have now decided to do it with this week's readings, _The Devil's Historians._&#x20;

In addition, your goal by the end of this week, i.e. by Monday, September 26th, you should make a series of [permanent note](broken-reference)s listing / describing the major myths of the Middle Ages suggested by Sturtevant and Kaufman's work. It should be posted to your Student Work folder by the start of class on Monday the 26th. A detailed guide for completing this are available here:&#x20;

### Going Further

You are only expected to read the first chapter of Kaufman and Sturtevant's work but you can read more (each section of chapter one corresponds to a subsequent chapter). You can also check out the origin of some of their writing on the public blog: [The Public Medievalist](https://www.publicmedievalist.com) devoted to looking at representations of the Middle Ages in popular culture.&#x20;

Another way to think about "myths" of the Middle Ages is to see them as cultural _tropes_. For pop culture ideas, I always recommend the site [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges).&#x20;
