# Case Study: Chess I

### Goals for this week (October 17/19th)

Today, we are exploring the medieval history of chess, as a case study for how to think about historical games.&#x20;

* Monday we will discuss Spanos' chapter on chess, and see the different forms of analysis he suggests we could take with the game of chess as historians
* On Wednesday, we will explore how to communicate the rules of chess without a chess board in front of you. The goal is to test your ability to communicate the rules of chess just with spoken words. Read through the [outline of the in-class exercise](../course-info/assignments/6.-in-class-exercise-game-communication.md). Students will be divided into _tutors_ and _pupils_ with different responsibilities.
