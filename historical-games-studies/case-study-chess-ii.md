# Case Study: Chess II

### Goals for this week (October 31st /November 2nd)

This week we consider, using the case study of chess, the idea of games as material sources. They are objects that have a solidity, a provenience and a materiality. We will thus consider how games can be understood as material or visual evidence of the past.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

Spanos, Apostolos. _Games of History: Games and Gaming as Historical Sources_. Milton: Taylor and Francis, 2021. This book is available as an open access book ([you can download it here](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-mono/10.4324/9780429342479/games-history-apostolos-spanos); a pdf is posted on Teams, the publisher's "read online" option, no longer works and the pdf's to scroll through can't be annotated with hypothes.is.&#x20;

* chapter 2. "Material Approaches to Games"

Examine a decorated games box, dating from 1440-1470; made of bone, wood (beech), and iron fittings. Located at the Walters Art Gallery (Baltimore, MD) Accession no. 71.93.

Take a look at the following game pieces:

* [https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H\_1831-1101-84](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H\_1831-1101-84) \[The Lewis Chessman, as these are called, are among the most famous medieval game pieces, and demonstrate a style often copied in medieval-themed games. Note that antequated title of the objects as "chessmen" – even though they would be better described as a "Chess set" given the presence of the Queen piece...].

### Practice

Before November 2nd's class, complete a _Game Object Note_ in Obsidian. This will require that students download and add a new simple template to your Obsidian vault. On November 2nd, we will discuss three different chess pieces, which you will have written about, as described in [exercise 8](../course-info/assignments/8.-in-class-exercise-material-culture.md).&#x20;

### Going Further

Read Schulte Michael (2017), “Board Games of the Vikings – From Hnefatafl to Chess”, Maal og minne (2): 1–42. [https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268146544.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268146544.pdf)

You can compare medieval European chess sets to those produced in the Persian/Islamic context. These are from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. For other chess pieces in their collection, [follow this link](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/140009308).&#x20;

Many institutions have game collections, but in Rochester (NY) there is the Strong Museum of Play, entirely devoted to the idea and is home to a game research library, archives and the International Centre for the History of Electronic Games. Check out its online exhibitions!
