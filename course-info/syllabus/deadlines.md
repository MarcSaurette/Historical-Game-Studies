# Deadlines

Assignments need to be completed on time.

Please let me know (in advance) if there are good reasons for why you can't get something in one time, and we can try to find possible solutions (see below, [Extensions](deadlines.md#extensions-and-accommodations)).

### Extensions and Accommodations

As far as I am concerned, you do not need to give me (Marc Saurette) a doctor's note or a self-declaration form of illness. You can just let me know if problems or illnesses have arisen and we can discuss timelines and strategies for you to complete your work. If you have been sick and this has delayed you from completing assignments, please let me know sooner rather than later so that we can work with you to come up with a new plan/ timeline. I understand that illness can mess up your intended work timeline, so the more information I know, the more I can help you plan.
