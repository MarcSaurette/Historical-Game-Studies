# Communication

### The short answer

Speak with me in or before/after class for mostly everything.

Almost all communication outside the classroom should happen via the [Teams](../digital-tools/teams.md) platform. We can message privately, post general messages to channels, we can meet in an audio or videoconference as a whole or in small groups/ one-on-one.

By using Teams to communicate, you are much more likely to get a quick response.&#x20;

Only rarely should you email me (the professor) because it'll likely get caught in an email backlog.&#x20;
