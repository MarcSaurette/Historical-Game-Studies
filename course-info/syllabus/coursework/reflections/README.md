# Writing

{% hint style="info" %}
I want students to have the freedom to pursue work which best suits their academic and professional goals. Instead of each student completing the same assignments, you can take different pathways for your independent work.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

All students will complete the first assignment –an annotated bibliography– which will orient you towards your future projects. After completing your annotated bibliography, you will choose which project pathway you wish to take:

* game analysis
* game design
* game pedagogy

By going down one of these three pathways, you will be able to explore one of the key pillars of the discipline of historical games studies.&#x20;
