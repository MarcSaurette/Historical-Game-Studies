For much of the first term, students will work on understanding the videogame _Crusader Kings III_ with the tools provided by Fern√°ndez-Varro's _Introduction to Game Analysis_ and McCall's concept of the _Historical Problem Space_.&#x20;

Starting halfway through Fall term, we will begin to work on the major project of the term. Each week on [Obsidian](../../../digital-tools/obsidian/), students will be responsible for completing one more step of the overall project. And at the end of term, each student will write up their findings as a larger essay.&#x20;

Details about the project will be distributed before reading week.&#x20;

* Student will work on **draft sections** of the project week by week starting after Fall reading week, usually introduced by in-class tutorials.&#x20;
* A **final version** of the weekly assignments (with an introduction and conclusion, and in proper academic style) will be due (along with the supporting material in your Obsidian vault) on December 9th, 4pm.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The final version of the game journal should be uploaded to your Student Work folder, inside a folder called something like, "YourLastName - CKIII Game Journal - Final Draft".&#x20;

You have been doing work on this project week by week, but your final draft should also offer:

1. revised game-journal notes to integrate them with one another (embedded sections or links from one note to another). The overview page could embed text from subsidiary notes.&#x20;
2. revisions made to notes to reflect the knowledge learned in completing subsequent notes? (i.e. the Overview note will likely need to be heavily revised once all the other notes are completed)
3. An introduction (new note) should be written to highlight the key points you came across in your analysis.&#x20;
4. A bibliography note, i.e. a list of any sources cited or consulted (linked to reference notes, ideally). &#x20;
