# History Game Design

### Goals:&#x20;

* Consider how to design a History Game
* Examine examples of history games designs and evaluate the success or the compromises necessary to the process.&#x20;
* Begin work on exercise 5: this framework will give you the structure to complete your annotated bibliography.&#x20;

Potential Questions:&#x20;

* Rouse's chapter on Game Design highlights their key idea about game design - player choice. In the games that you play, how important is having the ability to solve a challenge in different ways? Which games do this best, do you find? And how, if you were creating a history game, would you balance player choice with historical accuracy?
* What is a counterfactual game in Grufstedt's writing? How might students apply her definition to their own research?
* Grufstedt (p. 77) talks about how Rockstar games use History as "clout" - a way to signal authenticity more for marketing than a game pillar. Do you see that in other games and should this concern us as historians?&#x20;
