# 7. Game Journal - Overview

### Starting Point:

The work of Clara Fernándex-Vara and Jeremiah McCall are two useful starting points for learning how:&#x20;

1. to conduct formal academic analysis of games&#x20;
2. to apply this analysis as a historian.

Fernández-Vara, Clara. _Introduction to Game Analysis_. New York: Routledge, 2015. (Link to [Library Catalogue](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL\_CRL/hgdufh/alma991002172329705153)). This text can only be consulted by one library user at a time, so I have posted a pdf on Teams for consultation as well.&#x20;

Jeremiah McCall has written extensivey on historical video games. A good starting point for the project are two articles/blog posts, laying out a framework for studying games in history:

* [http://gamestudies.org/2003/articles/mccall](http://gamestudies.org/2003/articles/mccall)
* [https://eolt.org/articles/history-games](https://eolt.org/articles/history-games)

### Requirements

* have Crusader Kings III installed
* have Obsidian working
* have access to the internet (with some bandwith)

### Instructions

#### 1. Install Crusader Kings III

{% hint style="info" %}
The goal of the game journal project is that everyone in class is going to play a medieval videogame and each of us is going to discuss our experiences of doing so, week by week in the second half of first term. Students with a strong desire to work an alternate game (and an explicit rationale† for why they want to) can focus on a different game, but must clear it with the professor first.&#x20;



It will be the responsibility of the student to adapt the assignment instructions to the game they choose.&#x20;



† This might be that you do not have a computer able to play the _CKIII._
{% endhint %}

1. Install Crusader Kings III on a computer. I am giving detailed instructions here, as if you have not used Steam before. I suspect many of you have and perhaps some already have played _CKIII._ If so, skip to section 2.&#x20;

* Install Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/about/](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)
* Open Steam, sign in (or register for a new account):​

3\. Once you've signed in and got Steam working and you've gotten past all the ads, you will need to add _Crusader Kings III_ to your library. Click on the "Add a Game" button on the bottom left corner of the window (at least in the Mac version).&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 2.54.34 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then click on "Activate a Product on Steam". It will request that you sign a User Agreement. Offer your consent or they won't allow you to continue.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.02.24 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.02.11 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click </p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Then you will be brought to this screen. I will message those who need it, a code for the game _Crusader Kings III_ privately on Teams. Do not share these with anyone else.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.02.37 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you type the code in correctly and I've sent on the right code, Steam will add the game to your Libary on Steam. It will require that you then install the game. There should be an easy to find button to do so. Eventually, once the game is downloaded, the Steam window will look like this:&#x20;

#### 2. Prepare to Analyze the Game

(from Fernández-Carro, _Introduction to Game Analysis_) p.50.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a general description of how to set up and gather information about your game. Throughout the process, be sure to take notes, either summarizing key ideas, or jotting down your own impressions. It will make it easier to start writing and prevent writer’s block later on.
{% endhint %}

**Step 1: Gathering basic contextual info:**

* If the copy of the game does not have manuals/box (as ours does not), find it online if they exist.
  * Find ads for the game (commercial, print ads, official website).
  * Find online forums where people discuss the game

**Step 2: Learn how to play the game:**

* Go through the tutorial and get familiar with the controls.
* If you choose to play beyond the tutorial, find the difficulty level that you are comfortable with or that you may be interested in playing.
* Explore the different game modes; decide which one you will focus on.
* Think about what it means to finish the game, and what it means to cheat.
* Why is the game interesting? What parts of the game should you be focusing on if we are thinking of analyzing the game from a historical perspective?

**Step 3: Play the game:**

* Play however much you need to finish the game (or get an idea of how it finishes)
* Always be taking notes of your gameplay:
  * You are not writing a walkthrough (those are available, both commercially and by volunteers/fans).
  * Take notes of whatever is relevant to your analysis
    * surprising aspects of the interaction;
    * assumptions made by the game (e.g., in the representation, in the design);
    * frustrations/things that are broken; recurring patterns (in the design, themes, etc.);
    * relationships with the context;
    * elements of the design that may appeal to the audience;
    * what the game is about based on the mechanics (vs. what it says on the box).
* If you are doing a historical analysis, find elements that may point to its socio-historical context.

After playing the game, you should have a sizeable amount of information to start writing.

#### 3. Play Tutorial

1. Once you hit the play button, this will launch the Paradox launcher and will start the game. Click on new game. And then click on "Play Tutorial" in the top right corner.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Some of you have already played this game, but I still wish you to replay the tutorial level so that we can all be able to talk about the same material (at first at least, you can go off in your own direction later).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

<div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.20.17 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "New Game"</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.20.49 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The "Play Tutorial" button is on the top right corner</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.20.56 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click Play Tutorial again and get started. </p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Depending how familiar you are with this kind of videogame, you might only play the tutorial (possibly more than once to understand different aspects of the game design), or you will play it once before launching into other scenarios.&#x20;

Your goal for this week is to try to play through the tutorial. This will likely take a few hours, or more if you are new to the genre/ interface. **Get playing!**

#### 4. Your first Journal Entry

So you've played some Crusader Kings III. Congratulations for getting through the tutorial, it is a pretty complicated game so it takes some time and thought. If you are confused, know that many in the class are too.&#x20;

As you play, you should try to document your game play. This can take the form of screenshots or recorded gameplay and written/typed notes.&#x20;

1. Create a reference note for _Crusader Kings III_ by following (if necessary) the instructions in [exercise no. 4.](4.-writing-up-a-reference-note.md#game-reference-note) In addition to the basic game information, you should specify what version of the game you are playing (shown via Steam launcher), and what your operating system (OS) is (different operating system allow you to interact with the game slightly differently)...
2. Create a game play note. Begin to make notes on the following topics (organized from the more general/vague to more complex/detailed). You can do this in different ways. You can create a **Daily Note** (by clicking on the calendar icon in the sidebar; it creates a note titled with today's date, allowing you to track what you did each day you play); **or** you can develop a single **permanent note** entitled, "Crusader Kings III - Gameplay" (or something similar) addressing the following key topics: McCall (_Gaming the Past_, 2011, p. 97) suggests you consider the following questions:
   1. What have been your experiences trying to play the game?
   2. Describe your game session.
   3. What was the role and goal of your assumed character in the game?
   4. What challenges did your character face, and how successfully did your character overcome these challenges?
   5. Describe one system the game employs.&#x20;
      1. Jeremiah McCall's work focuses on systems, but for an overview of the literature on games as systems see [the following](https://eolt.org/articles/game-definition) tertiary source.&#x20;
      2. The idea of systems for our purposes are perhaps best explained in McCall's [2022 online artice for Game Studies](http://gamestudies.org/2003/articles/mccall) journal.&#x20;
   6. Raise at least two questions about the past that your play-session inspired.
   7. Does the game effectively demonstrate the key factors in the success or failure of the player?
   8. **Speculate**: explain one aspect of the game that you think is historically accurate and offer reasons in support.
   9. **Speculate**: suggest one aspect of the game that you suspect is historically inaccurate and offer reasons in support.
