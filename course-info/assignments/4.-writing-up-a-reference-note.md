# 4. Writing up a Reference note

### Goals

This week, you are asked to write up two different kinds of reference notes:

1. a reference note for a traditional academic article
2. a "reference" note for a game

### Requirements:

You will need to have Obsidian set up.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Since references are made to sources/objects that could theoretically be consulted by other people, childhood games (tag, hide-and-go-seek) cannot be referenced bibliographically so, I want you to limit your&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Bibliographic Reference Note

1. Create a new note in Obsidian. This will be a note referencing [the reading for this week](../../historical-games-studies/medieval-games.md#read-watch-listen): i.e.   the first chapter of Apostolos Spanos's _Games of History: Games and Gaming as Historical Sources_.
2. Title the note: "Spanos - 2021".&#x20;
3. Insert a template, but clicking on the "template icon" on the lefthand sidebar of Obsidian. Then Insert "ref-note-template". It will look like this now:

<div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-30 at 11.37.39 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Note with template added</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-30 at 11.37.15 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Insert a template</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

4\. Your goal for making reference notes is that you will build up a library (a veritable database) of readings pertinent for the topic. This means that if you write up a reference here once, it will be ready to be reused any future time you might need it.&#x20;

5\.  I want you to cite Spanos' book chapter three ways according to Chicago style of references:

> The[ Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools\_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html) (which is mostly used by historians) uses the following template for citation of books and book chapters:
>
>
>
> _**Chapter or other part of an edited book**_
>
> In a note, cite specific pages. In the bibliography, include the page range for the chapter or part.
>
> **Note**
>
> 1. Henry David Thoreau, “Walking,” in _The Making of the American Essay_, ed. John D’Agata (Minneapolis: Graywolf Press, 2016), 177–78.
>
> **Shortened note**
>
> 1. Thoreau, “Walking,” 182.
>
> **Bibliography entry**
>
> Thoreau, Henry David. “Walking.” In _The Making of the American Essay_, edited by John D’Agata, 167–95. Minneapolis: Graywolf Press, 2016.

6\. Using this format, cite Spanos' book as a note, shortened note and bibliography entry. I have placed a [sample version](https://cmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/sites/MEMS2001977/Shared%20Documents/General/fysm1405A-obsidian-shared/References/Spanos%20-%202021.md?csf=1\&web=1\&e=EanceF) of the note in the "reference" folder of the shared class Obsidian folder on teams. Download this note from Teams and add it to your Obsidian vault before editing it. I want you:

* cite the book chapter in three different formats
* the link to the electronic version of the text (which is slightly different than the printed book itself)
* right up a short summary of the key ideas of the book (its thesis, who the author is, what kind of evidence is uses).&#x20;
* tags
* links to other notes that you might think are linked

7\. You're done part I. Add this note to your Student Work folder on Teams.

### Game Reference Note

The second note is to create a game reference note. As this is a new field, there is not a clear standard, but we will try to establish a template.&#x20;

1. Create a new note in Obsidian.&#x20;
2. Insert a template. Select "game-reference-template".

<div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 10.34.23 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 10.33.54 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

3\. Your goal is now to add a reference to a game. Any game works (I would of course prefer if it was a game that could be considered "medieval-ish", i.e. a game that seems to take place in the Middle Ages), but it should be something you have at hand (or could borrow from a . Something released in the last 40 years maybe, so that the publication information is more clear. I've posted [a sample note on Teams](https://cmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/sites/MEMS2001977/Shared%20Documents/General/fysm1405A-obsidian-shared/References/CaracassonneBigBox-2006.md?csf=1\&web=1\&e=LfoMdI) in the shared Obsidian vault, in the "Reference" folder. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Best not to try to cite a game from the Middle Ages –this is harder to cite, and we'll come back to how to do that in a[ future week](../../historical-games-studies/case-study-chess-ii.md)). If you need a game to cite, I have several in my office that you can borrow/ look at to get the key information. Or various other medievalish games are posted on Teams ([folder here](https://cmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/MEMS2001977/Shared%20Documents/General/Games%20Resources?csf=1\&web=1\&e=LGZiCZ)).
{% endhint %}

4\. Following along with the sample note, add the bibliographic information for your game. Essentially, the game does not matter, it is the process of putting information into a consultable format that is the goal here.&#x20;

5\. In the Game-Reference-Template I have offered two models - one for citing a boardgame and the other for a videogame. The first is easier usually, because there is less information to capture (videogames usually have much larger design teams etc) and the information to capture has more variability (you need to specify the platform, version, if you have any DLC added etc.)

6\. Write up a note outlining the **game information, provide a short summary of what the game is, add tags, links** to marketing/distribution sites online, rulebooks, etc. If you are referencing a boardgame, often[ Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com) (an online database of games and reviews) is a useful link. It can also be useful, especially at this point, to see how boardgames are tagged by designers/ superfans to get a sense of how games are perceived/categorized. For videogames, Yannick Rochat (whom we will read in a [future week](../../historical-games-studies/digital-games-survey-of-medieval-videogames.md)) suggests using the [MobyGames database](https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?q=medieval) for searching for videogame trends.&#x20;

When you are done, upload the note to your student work folder.&#x20;
