# Experimenting with Learning

{% hint style="info" %}
Starting graduate school can be an especially difficult transition. So, please, if you need some help (in class, in life) please reach out to me so I can do whatever I can or put you in contact with people who can help.&#x20;

Teaching and learning this year will be an experiment. We will be using software ([Obsidian](../../digital-tools/obsidian/)) that few (or none) of you have used before and it requires some getting used to. And I am teaching this course for the first time. You may be asked to do assignments which are totally unfamiliar to you. I likely will have expectations and forms of etiquette which differ from those of other professors. Thus we should all try to be extra patient and understanding when things don't go as smoothly as we'd like.

### Things to Keep in Mind

To succeed in this seminar, it may require a different kind energy and discipline from you than a traditional lecture course. I am going to ask you to learn differently than is typical, but with the knowledge that _this process will make it easier for you in the long term and you will be smarter for it._&#x20;

**Willingness to experiment**: Part of this course will be playing or making games. You need to be willing to try new things and not to worry too much about getting things exactly right. Trying and failing to do something can often teach more than getting it perfectly right the first time. Students need to embrace the idea that class is an experiment in learning.&#x20;

**Motivation**: Motivation can always be challenging. Over the course of the term, we will all get busier and have other demands on our time - being a teaching assistant, outside work, or school work for other classes you're taking.  I hope the face-to-face time in the classroom (especially with your peers) can provide energy and motivation to give your best. If you are having problems with motivation, think about coming to talk with me to see if there is a better way to get you working.&#x20;

**Difficulty of concentration**: One of the reasons that I believe in-person classes remain so important, even in our digital age, is because it gives us spaces in which we can switch off our devices and all of the distractions they offer, and hone the absolutely vital skill of concentration (a skill that is key both for having a successful learning experience in this course, but also for life in general). Carving out spaces of intensive concentration (while in class, doing your readings, working on your syntheses and other written assignments at home) will no doubt be much more challenging, for a variety of reasons.

**Tech problems**: no doubt there will be both a significant learning curve for all of us in terms of how the various pieces of software work, as well as a variety of inevitable tech mishaps. Weâ€™ll have to become skilled at quickly solving problems together. I am no tech genius but hopefully together we can sort out issues.&#x20;
