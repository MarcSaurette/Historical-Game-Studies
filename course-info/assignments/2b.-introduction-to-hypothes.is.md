# 2. Introduction to Hypothes.is\*

### Requirements

In order for you to complete this exercise, you will need to have

* successfully logged into the class [Teams](../digital-tools/teams.md)
* signed up for a [Hypothes.is](../digital-tools/hypothes.is.md) account

### What you need to do

1. write hypothes.is annotations on readings for week 2 - "What are Games and why do they interest historians?".&#x20;

### Steps&#x20;



First, however, you need to have registered for an account, got hypothes.is [set up](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/gaming-the-middle-ages/course-info/digital-tools/hypothes.is) in a browser, and you need to have joined the class annotation group (Click [this link](https://hypothes.is/groups/1PgDxDb1/historical-games-studies) to join after you have created an account).

**So read and make 5** [**annotations**](../syllabus/coursework/readings/) on the reading for week 3 instead, the introduction and first chapter of [_The Devil's Historians_](https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks5/upress5/2020-06-01/1/9781487587871#page=10) _**by Monday, September 19th.**_ Using hypothes.is, once it is installed is as easy as selecting text, clicking an option and typing your note. The interface looks like this:

The text you are reading is on the left, and annotations (comments/ notes) are on the right.&#x20;

When you select the text with your mouse/cursor, you are given the option to annotate or highlight. Choose "annotate".&#x20;

Once you choose annotate, you can type as much as you wish and add a tag to help categorize your annotation (this is an important step!)

Annotations look like this, once they are posted:

After you have made 5 annotations, return to Obsidian and create a new note, either by pressing the page icon on the top left corner of the left sidebar, or pressing the keystroke (command + N \[mac]; (control + N \[PC] )

Once you have created a new note, give it a title, something like, "Literature Note for Sturtevant-Kaufman - 2020". And then before you add any text to the note itself click on the "Open Comman Palette" icon.&#x20;

Then, once that window is open, starting typing "insert"

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.59.32 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will reduce the number of options you can choose. Click on "Templater: Open Insert Template Modal". And then, click on "hypothesis".

The first time you use "templater" in a vault, Obsidian will require you to give it your user token. This is so that Obsidian can access your hypothesis annotations and download them seamlessly.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.00.03 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Navigate to the address provided ([https://hypothes.is/account/developer](https://hypothes.is/account/developer)) in a browser in which you are signed on to hypothesis. This page will provide you with a series of numbers and letters that you should copy and paste into the Obsidian window. You will then be asked how to import the annotations.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.10.44 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Choose the first option. And use the url for _The Devil's Historians is_ [_https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks5/upress5/2020-06-01/1/9781487587871#annotations:w6hExjXcEe25k0PGvdul6Q_](https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks5/upress5/2020-06-01/1/9781487587871#annotations:w6hExjXcEe25k0PGvdul6Q)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.11.14 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now, because of the vagaries of proxies and permissions of accessing Library resources hosted by academic publishers behind paywalls. If the URL given doesn't work, use templater again and instead use "Retrieve annotations from a day" and then choose the date (year, month, day) that you made the annotations (likely today's date).&#x20;

You will then get a note populated with quotations from the source you read and your comments on it. Hypothes.is (and then Obsidian) will provide a title inside your note for the work you annotated, but they are not always relevent (i.e. the academic publisher "Scholar's Portal" substitutes for the name of the book you read.&#x20;

Locate this .md file (mine was called "Literature Note for Sturtevant-Kaufman - 2020.md") and drag it into your Student Work folder on Teams. If you haven't created a folder for yourself in Student Work (which is unlikely), navigate to the General channel, click on the "Files" toptab, then click on "Student Work" folder to open it, and then within that, create your self-named folder by clicking on the purple "New" button. Then upload your md file by dragging and dropping into your newly created folder.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.27.11 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

And finally, right click on your md file in Teams and "copy link". Post this link in the "My first Literature Notes link" in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11qySQYeDCusmpIE28vK8rXUAB9KG5S8Ex-gD5SdNE6g/edit?usp=sharing). On this spreadsheet also add other information requested, that you have developed during the [tutorial level](broken-reference).&#x20;

### Great! You're done!
