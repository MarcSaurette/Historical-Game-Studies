# Installing Obsidian

To install Obsidian on your computer or device, navigate to [https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). The landing page will ask you to download files or will link you to an App store. Click on the button (in my case, since I'm using a Mac, it suggests I should download the version for macOS. You can also locate the best install package for your computer at [https://obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download).

Do what you need to do to install it. In macOS, I needed to double click on the downloaded file, and then drag the Obsidian app file into my applications folder. If you're using Windows or Linux, this will look a bit different, but should be relatively easy (and similar) to do.&#x20;

When you successfully install Obsidian and get it running, it will open with a window that looks like this; except if you're using it for the first time you won't have any "vaults" in the sidebar. You can create your own to test out how it works, but I will also create a starter vault for the course for you to download (with readings, templates etc.).
