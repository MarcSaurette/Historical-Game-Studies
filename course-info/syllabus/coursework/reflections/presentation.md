# Presentation

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no mark assigned for the presentation, so that your focus is the real objective â€“ sharing your ideas in a low stress environment.
{% endhint %}

On March 14th and 21st, students will present their work on assignments 1 and 2, with an eye to assignment 3. The goal of the presentation is to introduce your fellow students to your on-going work and get their feedback, advice, and suggestions (i.e. constructive criticism). You should consider the presentation to be less about defending what you've written (in the manner of a test) and more like a brainstorming session for how you're thinking of developing the ideas further.&#x20;

In advance of your presentation (at least a week), you will need to share your second assignment with the class to allow students to digest your work in advance.&#x20;

Your presentation should include:

* a clear statement of what you accomplished in the second assignment&#x20;
* a clear statement of what you hope to accomplish in the third assignment
* be able to think about some problems you have encountered so far in your work (and you might need help with in accomplishing for your future work).&#x20;

Students who are not presenting, are responsible for reading the other projects and being prepared to make concrete suggestions to help the presented advance their work (e.g. additional books to read, unmentioned pathways to pursue).
