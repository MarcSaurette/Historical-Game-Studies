# 2. Introduction to Hypothes.is\*

### Requirements

In order for you to complete this exercise, you will need to have

* successfully logged into the class [Teams](../digital-tools/teams.md)
* downloaded and installed [Obsidian](../digital-tools/obsidian/)
* signed up for a [Hypothes.is](../digital-tools/hypothes.is.md) account

### What you need to do

1. write hypothes.is annotations on readings for week 2 - "What are Games and why do they interest historians?".&#x20;
2. create a markdown file using Obsidian which imports your annotations

### Steps

1 - Download the class "starter vault", called "fysm1405A-obsidian-course-handbook" from Teams. You can find the folder in the files of the general channel. To find this, make sure you have clicked on the "General" channel in left sidebar, and then click on "Files" in the topbar to the right.&#x20;

2 - Right-click or click the elipsis (...) to select "download". In some versions of Teams you can drag and drop the folder onto your device.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 12.32.11 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3 - This folder will likely download to your device as a compressed .zip file. Most computers will automatic unpack the zip file. If not, do so as your particular device permits. Place the folder somewhere on your computer you will easily find it – move it out of "downloads" – its mostly like location, maybe into your "documents" folder. I have a folder named "Obsidian Vaults" to make it easy).&#x20;

4 - Open up Obsidian. You will be presented with the screen that looks like the following. Choose the option, "Open Folder as Vault".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 3.12.09 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It will ask you whether you trust the author of this vault. Press, "Trust author and enable plugins". Otherwise, everything gets much harder. Let's avoid that.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 3.13.01 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The vault will open up with the settings panel open. If you want, you can click on "Check for updates" to update any plugins are installed by default in our vault. There are lots of ways for you to customize your Obsidian set up, but I think you should save doing that for later – once you've had some time with the software first. Close the settings panel.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 3.14.30 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Obsidian should show something like this window (below). On the left side of the window should be a list of files in the vault and on the right side there will be either no note or maybe this one. Read through the instructions of note "01-Getting Started". It has some instructions on how to write a note.&#x20;

The page icon lets you create a new note. Open a new one and write something. Anything. Try different formatting. Try to link to a preexisting note.&#x20;

The vault icon on the bottom left (it looks like an old fashioned safe) lets you open or create vaults. The cog icon lets you play with the settings. We'll ignore those for now.&#x20;

Maybe watch the linked youtube video in the "Getting Started note", a short strangely-hypnotic video that shows the basics of Obsidian: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88). This is the first in a series of videos outlining the fundamentals of Obsidian.&#x20;

Reread the note to get memorize the different ways to use Obsidian (including using tags and links - its key tool).&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 3.19.29 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now navigate to note "02 - Create notes from your hypothesis annotations".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 11.46.01 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By following the instructions on this note, you will create a new note in Obsidian to import annotations from Hypothes.is.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The instructions in the Obsidian note "02-Create notes from Hypothes.is" contain a quick overview of what you need to do to import hypothesis annotations into Obsidian. What follows is a much more detailed step by step explanation, should you need it.&#x20;

If you succesfully annotate and import your annotations into Perusal, make sure to post your note to Teams, into the Student Work folder (create a folder in there with your name first).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

First, however, you need to have registered for an account, got hypothes.is [set up](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/gaming-the-middle-ages/course-info/digital-tools/hypothes.is) in a browser, and you need to have joined the class annotation group (Click[ this link](https://hypothes.is/groups/q2GDRx7E/gaming-the-middle-ages) to join after you have created an account).

{% hint style="danger" %}
In the second week of class, students were expected to read and annotate Danielle Kinsey's article "[Three Points About History, Especially for Non-Historians](https://www-utpjournals-press.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.3138/cjh.ach.54.1-2.01)". So originally, it was going to the text for this exercise. So far, however, of the members of class who have successfully joined the annotation group, none have made any annotations. So let's jump to the reading for the third week.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**So read and make 5** [**annotations**](../syllabus/coursework/readings/) on the reading for week 3 instead, the introduction and first chapter of [_The Devil's Historians_](https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks5/upress5/2020-06-01/1/9781487587871#page=10) _**by Monday, September 19th.**_ Using hypothes.is, once it is installed is as easy as selecting text, clicking an option and typing your note. The interface looks like this:

The text you are reading is on the left, and annotations (comments/ notes) are on the right.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.13.42 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you select the text with your mouse/cursor, you are given the option to annotate or highlight. Choose "annotate".&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.21.55 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you choose annotate, you can type as much as you wish and add a tag to help categorize your annotation (this is an important step!)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.23.25 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Annotations look like this, once they are posted:



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.29.50 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After you have made 5 annotations, return to Obsidian and create a new note, either by pressing the page icon on the top left corner of the left sidebar, or pressing the keystroke (command + N \[mac]; (control + N \[PC] )

Once you have created a new note, give it a title, something like, "Literature Note for Sturtevant-Kaufman - 2020". And then before you add any text to the note itself click on the "Open Comman Palette" icon.&#x20;



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.58.59 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.59.09 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then, once that window is open, starting typing "insert"

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.59.32 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will reduce the number of options you can choose. Click on "Templater: Open Insert Template Modal". And then, click on "hypothesis".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 12.59.51 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The first time you use "templater" in a vault, Obsidian will require you to give it your user token. This is so that Obsidian can access your hypothesis annotations and download them seamlessly.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.00.03 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Navigate to the address provided ([https://hypothes.is/account/developer](https://hypothes.is/account/developer)) in a browser in which you are signed on to hypothesis. This page will provide you with a series of numbers and letters that you should copy and paste into the Obsidian window. You will then be asked how to import the annotations.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.10.44 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Choose the first option. And use the url for _The Devil's Historians is_ [_https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks5/upress5/2020-06-01/1/9781487587871#annotations:w6hExjXcEe25k0PGvdul6Q_](https://books-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.carleton.ca/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks5/upress5/2020-06-01/1/9781487587871#annotations:w6hExjXcEe25k0PGvdul6Q)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.11.14 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now, because of the vagaries of proxies and permissions of accessing Library resources hosted by academic publishers behind paywalls. If the URL given doesn't work, use templater again and instead use "Retrieve annotations from a day" and then choose the date (year, month, day) that you made the annotations (likely today's date).&#x20;

You will then get a note populated with quotations from the source you read and your comments on it. Hypothes.is (and then Obsidian) will provide a title inside your note for the work you annotated, but they are not always relevent (i.e. the academic publisher "Scholar's Portal" substitutes for the name of the book you read.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.23.46 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Locate this .md file (mine was called "Literature Note for Sturtevant-Kaufman - 2020.md") and drag it into your Student Work folder on Teams. If you haven't created a folder for yourself in Student Work (which is unlikely), navigate to the General channel, click on the "Files" toptab, then click on "Student Work" folder to open it, and then within that, create your self-named folder by clicking on the purple "New" button. Then upload your md file by dragging and dropping into your newly created folder.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-16 at 1.27.11 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

And finally, right click on your md file in Teams and "copy link". Post this link in the "My first Literature Notes link" in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11qySQYeDCusmpIE28vK8rXUAB9KG5S8Ex-gD5SdNE6g/edit?usp=sharing). On this spreadsheet also add other information requested, that you have developed during the [tutorial level](broken-reference).&#x20;

### Great! You're done!
