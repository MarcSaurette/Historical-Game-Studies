# Free Topic II: Interactive Fiction

### Goals

The goal for this week is to consider in what ways History, historical fiction and games (including interactive fiction) tell stories (narratives). Our goal should be to consider how the medium affects how stories get told (e.g. print vs digital) and how History tells stories differently (or the same) due to its disciplinary requirements.&#x20;
