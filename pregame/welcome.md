# Prelude

### Goals for this week (January 11th, 2024)

By the end of the first week, what should you **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**? You will:

1. Know a bit about your professor and your fellow classmates
2. Learn what the course is all about and how we're going to run it
3. Figure out how to use some tools necessary for class
4. Create a quick [roll\&race](../course-info/assignments/1.-roll-and-race.md) historical game
5. &#x20;Sign up as seminar leaders for the term. [Sign up in linked google sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sc6SoN0CVrn\_x6d-plT6uRORx95Uh\_Oojer2ZXjaR1g/edit?usp=sharing)&#x20;

### Overview:

The class provides a transition back to school after Winter break. We'll discuss the syllabus and get to know one another. This week I want you to:&#x20;

1. Before class, read the syllabus and [schedule](../schedule.md) on Gitbook (i.e. this place). Identify any questions you have and write them down.&#x20;
2. Start to use [MS Teams](../course-info/digital-tools/teams.md) (activate, install and login to the class group).&#x20;
3. Read up about the[ Digital tools ](../course-info/digital-tools/)we'll be using this year.

### Read/Watch/Listen

Read the syllabus section of this course guide and also the sections on Digital Tools. Spend some time figuring out how this website works (it shows how my brain organizes information, but might take some time before it makes sense to yours).&#x20;

### Practice

In class, as a way to get to know one another and flex your (incipient/advanced) game design skills, we will work in small groups to develop a quick historical[ roll & race game](../course-info/assignments/1.-roll-and-race.md).

For next class, try out using hypothesis to annotate some or all of the readings.&#x20;

### Prepare

This week, you are asked to download, install, set up or sign up for the following:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../course-info/digital-tools/teams.md" %}
[teams.md](../course-info/digital-tools/teams.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../course-info/digital-tools/hypothes.is.md" %}
[hypothes.is.md](../course-info/digital-tools/hypothes.is.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../course-info/digital-tools/zotero/" %}
[zotero](../course-info/digital-tools/zotero/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Going Further

You might want to delve into podcasts on game studies or game design. This weeks suggestion is the [Ludology podcast](https://ludology.libsyn.com) which has this "biography" of the classic roll & race, [Candyland](https://ludology.libsyn.com/size/5/?search=candyland) (also available on Apple Podcasts and others).&#x20;
